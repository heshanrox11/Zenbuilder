**Hey ZenFam!** @everyone 

**New to ZenChain?** Here's everything you need to know about ZenQuest, XP, and how to earn your $ZTC rewards! Let’s break it down 👇

<a:PurpleCheck:1298595192928079882> **What is ZenChain?**
ZenChain is a new Layer 1 (L1) built for native Bitcoin interoperability.
Imagine an L1 that speaks Bitcoin fluently—no wrappers, no federated bridges.
Heard of Bitcoin L2s? This is something different.

🎁 **ZenQuest: The Incentivized Testnet Campaign**
ZenQuest is ZenChain’s reward-based testnet campaign.
You earn XP by completing missions and using the testnet.

**ZenQuest XP** = your contribution score. The more XP you earn, the bigger your future share of $ZTC.

**How to Earn XP**
There are two main ways to earn XP in ZenQuest:

⛓️ ***On-Chain Missions   |   🌐 Social Missions***

⛓️ **On-Chain Missions (Testnet)**
You’ll need to directly interact with the ZenChain testnet.
Currently active missions:
- Transfer ZTC tokens
- Deploy a smart contract
More on-chain missions coming soon!

🌐 **Social Missions**
Earn rewards for supporting the ecosystem and spreading the word. Examples include:
- Contributing in the Discord community
- Sharing awesome ZenChain content
- Winner quizzes, games & events. And much more...

<:Colorfulabstract3Delements21440x:1288011808845860896> **The Role of $ZTC**
- $ZTC is ZenChain’s native token
- Used for gas, staking, governance, and more
- The XP you earn in ZenQuest will be converted into $ZTC when the mainnet launches

***ZenChain isn’t a short-term campaign… it’s the foundational layer for true cross-chain innovation. If you’ve ever wished you could actually do something with Bitcoin—this is the moment. Active early contributors will become a core part of the ecosystem from the very beginning.*** <a:pink_heart:1298595197156065322>
